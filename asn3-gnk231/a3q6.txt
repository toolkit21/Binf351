b)
Quagga: MF041986.1
Zebra top hit: JX312717.1
Donkey top hit: MK982180.1

Quagga is more closely related to Zebras than Donkeys

After performing the BLAST search of Quagga 12S Ribosomal RNA gene  vs Zebra and Quagga 12S Ribosomal RNA gene  vs. Donkey, the similarity of their sequences are:
	Quagga versus Zebra: 96.39%
	Quagga versus Donkey: 96.14%

The alignment scores are:
	Quagga versus Zebra: 684
	Quagga versus Donkey: 678

The ratios are similar however, Zebra is more closely related to Quagga


d)
The conclusion from part B stands that Zebra is more closely related to Quagga than Donkey. As shown in the Distant Matrix, Quagga and Zebra's 
evolutionary distance is lower than that of Quagga and Donkey. 

Also in the Prettyplot, it can be seen that Quagga and Donkey have more mismatches than Zebra

However all three species are very closely related but Zebra is more closely related to Quagga
