1.
First position synonymous substitutons
All syn subtitution	Synonymous codons in the 45 codons
AGA, CGA = arg		0
AGG,CGG = arg		0
CTA,TTA = leu		1 CTA
CTG,TTG = leu		8 CTG

Total synonymous substitutions = 1(1) + 8(1) = 9
Total substitutions possible = 45*3 = 135
Fraction of single mutations in first position that are synonymous in the 45 codons
= 9/135x100 = 6.67% synonymous
Fraction of single mutations in first position that are non-synonymous in the 45 codons
126/135x100 = 93.37%


Second position synonymous substitutons
All syn subtitution  Synonymous codons
TAA,TGA=Stop	    0	

Total synonymous substitution in second position
0/135 = 0% synonymous
Total non synonymous substitution in second position
135/135x100 = 100%


2. “At which codon position is natural selection likely to have
the greatest effect and are nucleotides most likely to be conserved?”

Natural selection is likely to have greatest effect in 2nd codon position because it has the least synonymous substituition meaning more likely to be mutated per substitution causing defects in the gene and favoring natural selection.
Conserved nucleotides are most likely to be in the 2nd position because non-sysnonymous substitutions are less
likely than synonymous substitution therefore nulceotides will not be substituted as much here as other positions.
